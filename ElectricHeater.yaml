## 🚀 How It Works

1. The system continuously reads temperature using the **LM35**.
2. It displays the temperature on a **7-segment display**.
3. Based on the current temperature, it activates either the **heater** or **cooler**.
4. Every few seconds (based on a timer), the system saves the temperature to an **EEPROM** using the **I2C protocol**.

## 🧪 Future Improvements

- Add **UART interface** for serial communication with PC.
- Implement **temperature thresholds** through user input.
- Use an **LCD display** for more detailed output.
- Enable **data retrieval** from EEPROM for history analysis.
